# Budget Web App

## Description of Project

### Product Vision Statement

Aimed towards consumers who strive for budget management, the Budget Web App wants to elevate understanding of income and spending, resulting in a higher control over finance. Unlike other apps which often automatically and arbitrarily categorize purchases, we allow users to define their budget and how they want to view their spending. This will allow for both the presence of "intelligent" suggestions per say, as well as user-defined categories in the event that more accuracy is required/desired.

## Short History

The Budget Web App came to fruition when team member Jennifer Zeng mentioned how most popular budget apps fail to allow you to customized your categorizes when giving statistics towards your spending. This can often lead to an inaccurate portrayal of your spending. If you buy food and drinks from CVS, budget apps are likely to categorize this as a purchase under health because CVS is a pharmacy. Jennifer suggested we create a new app that would allow users to personalize their categorizes, giving a more accurate and personal reflection of someone's finances. This idea was later expanded to involve concepts of how we could use ML to predict future spending patterns and use known APIs to sync banking information.
